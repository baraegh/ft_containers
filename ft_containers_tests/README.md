## ft_container UNITest.

This is a simple UNITEST to test the implementation of the the various container types of the C++ standard
template library that we implement as school project.
these containers are coded in C++98, so any new feature of the containers IS NOT
implemented, but every old feature is present.

### Test environment :
The tests we built and run directly on macOS Mojave(10.14), Big sur(11.6) and also on Ubuntu gcc5/6/7.

### Test Content : 

  * [vector](https://github.com/mamoussa405/ft_containers/tree/main/vector) *(100%/100%)*
  * [map](https://github.com/mamoussa405/ft_containers/tree/main/map) *(100%/100%)*
  * [stack](https://github.com/mamoussa405/ft_containers/tree/main/stack) *(100%/100%)*
  * [set](https://github.com/mamoussa405/ft_containers/tree/main/set) *(100%/100%)*

### How to use :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mamoussa405/ft_containers_tests.git
$ cd ft_containers/tests
```

```
Add the path of the container you want to test to the appropriate tester (vector/map ...)
```

```
make vetor/map ...
```
### NOTES :
- The test is taking a little bit of time to compare outputs and timing (time complexity of each method).  
- The test tests all the methods, iterators, reverse iterator so please just bare with it till it is done.  
- If you get a TLE please run the test again, if you still get TLE more than 3 times in a row then it's time to optimize.  


### Observations :

This is very intensive test for the c++ containers [vector, stack, map, set].
